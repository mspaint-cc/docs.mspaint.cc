## Installing Obsidian in Roblox Studio
To install Obsidian in Roblox Studio, you can copy the [Library.lua](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deividcomsono/Obsidian/refs/heads/main/Library.lua) file into a modulescript and require it.

```lua
local Library = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("Obsidian"))
```

### Setting up Icons

If you want lucide icon support, save the [lucide icon registry](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deividcomsono/lucide-roblox-direct/refs/heads/main/source.lua) as a modulescript and require it.

```lua
local Library = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("Obsidian"))
local Icons = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("Lucide"))

-- Set Library Icon Module
Library:SetIconModule(Icons)
```

<Callout type="warn">
    Make sure to **use SetIconModule before you create anything UI related** (such as the window)
</Callout>

Then, you should be good to go! You can start by checking out the [Window](/obsidian/core/library#Window) section to create your first window, tab, groupbox and UI elements.

If you are too lazy to read the documentation, you can also check out the [example script](https://github.com/deividcomsono/Obsidian/blob/main/Example.lua).


## Addons
Due to Roblox Studio's limitations, only one addon is available for Roblox Studio at the moment. The [ThemeManager](/obsidian/core/addons/thememanager) addon is available to use (and it will not be able to save themes).

### Installing ThemeManager
To install the ThemeManager addon, you can copy the [addons/ThemeManager.lua](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deividcomsono/Obsidian/main/addons/ThemeManager.lua) file into a modulescript and require it.

```lua
local Obsidian = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("Obsidian")

local Library = require(Obsidian)
local ThemeManager = require(Obsidian:WaitForChild("ThemeManager"))
```

## Types
The library comes with a type definition file for the lsp.

You can find the type definition file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deividcomsono/Obsidian/refs/heads/main/Library.d.luau).
