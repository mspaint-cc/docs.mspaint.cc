## Installing Obsidian in Roblox Studio
To install Obsidian in Roblox Studio, you can copy the [Library.lua](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deividcomsono/Obsidian/refs/heads/main/Library.lua) file into a modulescript and require it.

```lua
local Library = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("Obsidian"))
```

## Addons
The library comes with several built-in addons such as **ThemeManager** and ~~**SaveManager**~~ (SaveManager is not available in Roblox Studio).

### Installing ThemeManager
To install the ThemeManager addon, you can copy the [addons/ThemeManager.lua](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deividcomsono/Obsidian/main/addons/ThemeManager.lua) file into a modulescript and require it.

```lua
local Obsidian = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("Obsidian")

local Library = require(Obsidian)
local ThemeManager = require(Obsidian:WaitForChild("ThemeManager"))
```
