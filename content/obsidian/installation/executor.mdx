## Installing Obsidian in an Executor
To install Obsidian in an executor environment, you can use the following code snippet to get the library:

```lua
local Library = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deividcomsono/Obsidian/refs/heads/main/Library.lua"))()
```

Then, create a window:

```lua
local Window = Library:CreateWindow({
    Title = "My Script",
    Footer = "v1.0.0",
    ToggleKeybind = Enum.KeyCode.RightControl,
    Center = true,
    AutoShow = true
})
```

## Addons
The library comes with several built-in addons such as **ThemeManager** and **SaveManager**.

```lua
local repo = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deividcomsono/Obsidian/main/"

local Library = loadstring(game:HttpGet(repo .. "Library.lua"))()
local ThemeManager = loadstring(game:HttpGet(repo .. "addons/ThemeManager.lua"))()
local SaveManager = loadstring(game:HttpGet(repo .. "addons/SaveManager.lua"))()
```
