## Using Obsidian in an Executor Environment
To use Obsidian in an executor environment, you can use the following code snippet to get the library:

```lua
local Library = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deividcomsono/Obsidian/refs/heads/main/Library.lua"))()
```

Then, you should be good to go! You can start by checking out the [Window](/obsidian/core/library#Window) section to create your first window, tab, groupbox and UI elements.

## Addons
The library comes with several built-in addons such as [ThemeManager](/obsidian/core/addons/thememanager) and [SaveManager](/obsidian/core/addons/savemanager).
