    1. The [Library](/obsidian/core/library) is the base of Obsidian, it contains all essential functions and data used to create and get data from the UI.
    2. The [Window](/obsidian/core/library#Window) is your base UI container. It hosts tabs, groupboxes and mostly everything that the user can interact with.
    3. UI Elements can only be created inside a object under the "Structure" section in the documentation.
