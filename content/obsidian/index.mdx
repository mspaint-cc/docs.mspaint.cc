## Introduction
Welcome to the documentation for Obsidian, a clean Roblox UI Library made by deivid for the [mspaint script hub](https://www.mspaint.cc).

*This is why the Library has an API modeled after the [LinoriaLib](https://github.com/mstudio45/linorialib) UI library (as that was the previous UI Library for mspaint).*

<Callout type="info">
    Any changes that are done to the Obsidian library will be reflected in our [LinoriaLib UI Fork](https://github.com/mstudio45/linorialib).
</Callout>

## Why Obsidian?
- Clean and simple UI
- Full Mobile and PC support
- Customizable themes
- Built-in Save Manager
- Maintained UI Library

## Installation
Obsidian is available to use on **Roblox Studio**, **Executors** and even **Next.js + Tailwind**. Please refer to the [installation guide](./obsidian/installation).

## Quick Start
Start from the [Window](/obsidian/core/library#Window) section to create your first window, tab, groupbox and UI elements.

If you are less into reading and more into checking code, the Obsidian example script can be found [here](https://github.com/deividcomsono/Obsidian/blob/main/Example.lua).
