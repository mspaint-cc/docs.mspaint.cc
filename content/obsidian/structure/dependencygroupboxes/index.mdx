Dependency groupboxes much like [dependency boxes](/obsidian/structure/dependencyboxes) are containers that hide and show elements contained within it based on the dependencies set.

The difference is that dependency groupboxes have actually "groupbox" like UI *(with no title and no side choice, the side is inherited from the parent groupbox's side)*.

<DemoDependencyGroupbox />

## Usage

You can create a Dependency Groupbox by calling the `AddDependencyGroupbox` method on a Groupbox.

```lua
local Toggles = Library.Toggles
local LeftGroupbox = MainTab:AddLeftGroupbox("Settings", "wrench")

LeftGroupbox:AddToggle("EnableAudio", {
    Text = "Enable Audio",
    Default = false
})

local AudioSettings = LeftGroupbox:AddDependencyGroupbox()

AudioSettings:AddSlider("Volume", {
    Text = "Volume",
    Default = 50,
    Min = 0,
    Max = 100,
    Rounding = 0
})

AudioSettings:SetupDependencies({
    { Toggles.EnableAudio, true }, -- Only show if EnableAudio is true
})
```

## Methods
