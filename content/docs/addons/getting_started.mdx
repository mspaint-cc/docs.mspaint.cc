## What are addons?
mspaint addons are unofficial and unchecked scripts that attaches themselves into a custom tab made for addons.

<Callout type="info">
  **Prerequisite** You should have a executor that has the ability to use the filesystem.
</Callout>

## How to enable addons
To enable addons, you must have created a folder in `mspaint/addons` found in your executor's workspace folder. Inside this folder, you can place your addons. The Addon tab does not appear if you do not have a single valid addon in the `mspaint/addons` folder.

<Callout type="warn">
  **BE CAREFUL!** any script you put in the `mspaint/addons` directory will be executed by the executor, we recommend you to only use addons from trusted sources or addons that are open source. We are not responsible for any damage caused by the addons, **YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!**
</Callout>

## How to create an addon
To create an addon, you simply create a lua file in the `mspaint/addons` folder. Then add addon info at the top of the file and you should be good to go. For more information on how to create an addon, check out the [api](api) section.
