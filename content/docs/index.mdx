## Introduction
To use mspaint, you must first get a executor that supports the Luarmor loader (e.g. [Solara](https://getsolara.dev), [Xeno](https://xeno.now), [AWP](https://bloxproducts.com/r/1177722124035706931#f1), [Zenith](https://bloxproducts.com/r/1177722124035706931#f2), [Potassium](https://robloxcheatz.com/affiliate/mspaint5) and more...)

<Callout type="info">
    You can buy cheap executor & mspaint keys at [RobloxCheatz](https://robloxcheatz.com/affiliate/mspaint5) and [BloxProducts](https://bloxproducts.com/?affiliate_key=mspaint)

Then, you need to get a key from the [Key System](/key-system) to use mspaint or buy a [lifetime key](/purchase/getting_started) to skip the key system.

Finally, execute the following code to access mspaint:


```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://api.luarmor.net/files/v3/loaders/002c19202c9946e6047b0c6e0ad51f84.lua"))()
```

<Callout type="warn">
    By **using/purchasing** mspaint products, you **automatically** agree to the [Terms of Service](https://www.mspaint.cc/tos). 
    Violating any of these terms will result in **permanent blacklist** from all **current and future** mspaint products.

    **YOU WILL NOT BE EXCUSED IF YOU DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE TERMS OF SERVICE OR ANY OF IT'S RULES, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!**

## Addon Installation
To install addons, you download the addons from the [Addon Form](https://discord.com/channels/1282361102935658777/1291556634597916705) in the mspaint discord server and place them in your executor's `workspace/mspaint/addons` folder (if it does not exist you can create it).

<Callout type="info">
    Some addons may not work properly due to our **addon system revamp**, if you are a addon developer and want to migrate to the new system you can check the documentation [here](/addons/api).

    Additionally, if you do not know anything about coding, you should not install any addons that are not marked as Safe by us.
