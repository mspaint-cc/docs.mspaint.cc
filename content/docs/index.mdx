## Introduction
To use mspaint, you must first get a executor that supports the Luarmor loader (e.g. [Seliware](https://seliware.com/), [Potassium](https://bloxproducts.com/?affiliate_key=mspaint#Potassium), [Solara](https://getsolara.dev/) and more...)

<Callout type="info">
    You can buy cheap executor & mspaint keys at [BloxProducts](https://bloxproducts.com/?affiliate_key=mspaint)!
    Learn more about purchasing with BloxProducts [here](/purchase/getting_started).
</Callout>

To be able to use mspaint, you need to get a key. You can get the key from the **Key System** or by purchasing a **Premium Key**:
    - [Key System](/key-system) (*certain features are locked*)
    - [Premium Key](/purchase/getting_started) (*skips the entire key system, every feature is unlocked*)

Finally, execute the following code to access mspaint:


```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://api.luarmor.net/files/v3/loaders/002c19202c9946e6047b0c6e0ad51f84.lua"))()
```

<Callout type="warn">

## Addon Installation
To install addons, you download the addons from the [Addon Form](https://discord.com/channels/1282361102935658777/1291556634597916705) in the mspaint discord server and place them in your executor's `workspace/mspaint/addons` folder (if it does not exist you can create it).

<Callout type="info">
    Some addons may not work properly due to our **addon system revamp**, if you are a addon developer and want to migrate to the new system you can check the documentation [here](/addons/api).

    Additionally, if you do not know anything about coding, you should not install any addons that are not marked as Safe by us.
