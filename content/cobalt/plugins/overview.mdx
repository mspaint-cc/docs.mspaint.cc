## What are plugins?
Plugins are scripts that extend the functionality of Cobalt. The plugin API gives you access to the spy, UI, code generation, and settings systems — allowing you to intercept remote calls, add custom UI, modify generated code, and more.

## Getting Started

On load, Cobalt creates the folder `Cobalt/Plugins` in your executor's workspace directory. To create a plugin, add a `.luau` or `.lua` file to that folder and set `Cobalt.PluginData` at the top of the file.

```lua
Cobalt.PluginData = {
    Name = "My Plugin",
    Description = "A short description of what this plugin does.",
    Author = "YourName",
    Version = "1.0.0",
    Game = "*",
}
```

## What can plugins do?

- **Intercept remote calls** — Hook into incoming and outgoing remote events/functions, suppress or modify log entries
- **Append virtual logs** — Inject decoded protocol traffic (e.g. ByteNet packets) as custom log entries
- **Customize code generation** — Override the generated code when copying calls, hooks, or instance paths
- **Create settings UI** — Add checkboxes, buttons, text inputs, and dropdowns that persist automatically
- **Build custom modals** — Create resizable, tabbed modal dialogs with footer buttons
- **Extend remote info** — Add custom tabs and footer buttons to the remote info panel
- **Add context menu options** — Add right-click options to the remote list and call list
- **Show notifications** — Display toast messages via `Cobalt.Sonner`
- **Lifecycle management** — Clean up resources when the plugin is unloaded
